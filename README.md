### Karl Horky - Teacher, Co-Founder, @upleveled

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Karl, an Austrian-Canadian programmer living in Vienna (originally from Vancouver and Victoria, B.C.).

Currently I'm passionate about building and teaching at @upleveled, a coding bootcamp for web development (incl. React, Node.js, Next.js, PostgreSQL). This is where I spend most of my time - ensuring that our students get the best education outcomes possible.
